Target : The topic is similar to Titanic, using the features in the data to find out which people will be transported.

The process is divided into 4 parts, namely EDA / fill null / models comparison / models predict


## 1.EDA
>Preliminary exploration of raw data.

raw data : 13 features & 1 label (transpored)


## 2.fill null 
>If there are highly correlated features in the existing data, fill missing values with the nearest available numerical values.

## 3.models comparison
>Compare the model's performance, runtime, and accuracy.

## 4.model predict
>Input the data into the model for prediction. Select the top five models based on accuracy for individual testing and comprehensive evaluation.
